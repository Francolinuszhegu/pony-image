## Project Introduction

[Pony](https://github.com/ponyorm/pony/) is an advanced object-relational mapper. The most interesting feature of Pony is its ability to write queries to the database using Python generator expressions and lambda expressions. This product is based on the Huawei Cloud EulerOS 2.0 64-bit system of Kunpeng servers, featuring Pony.

## Pony achieves this ease of use through the following ways

- Compact entity definition
- Concise query language
- Ability to work interactively with Pony in the Python interpreter
- Comprehensive error messages showing the exact part of the query where the error occurred
- Display of generated SQL in an indented and readable format
